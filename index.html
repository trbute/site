                <div>A grid-based cellular automaton where each cell exists in one of two states - alive or dead.</div>
                <br>
                <div>For each generation, the state of each cell is determined by the following rules: </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each living cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each living cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each living cell with two or three neighbors survives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each dead cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    The can be boiled down to two rules that define the criteria for each state to change:
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Living cells die with less than 2 or more than 3 living neighbors.</li>
                    <li>Dead cells become alive with exactly 3 living neighbors.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>This implementation uses HTML 5 Canvas to draw the grid and game state.</div>
                <div>Cells can be drawn or removed by left or right-clicking on the canvas.</div>
                <div>Middle mouse click and scroll wheel allow for pan and zoom.</div>
                <div>Various on-screen controls allow for navigating through the game state.</div>
